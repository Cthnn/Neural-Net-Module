# Neural-Net-Module
A module to teach students about neural nets.

This is a training module for students without experience with Neural Networks. The goal is to teach students at any level and guide them through the process of a machine learning problem. 

## Part 1: Machine Learning Theory

This will be a quick high-level lecture.

## Part 2: Feedforward Neural Networks

Open ANN_TORCH_MNIST.ipynb in Google Colab (instructions below)

## Part 3: Convolutional Neural Networks

Open CNN_TF_MNIST.ipynb and CNN_TORCH_MNIST.ipynb in Google Colab.

CNN_TF_MNIST will introduce students to a high-level deep learning library to build networks seamlessly. 
As a bonus this notebook also provides a two-line implementation of an SVM with scikit-learn.

CNN_TORCH_MNIST will show a PyTorch CNN implementation that achieves perfect accuracy.

## Part 4: Hyper Parameter Tuning Class Activity

Open CNN_TF_MNIST.ipynb and try to improve the network accuracy! There are instructions at the bottom of the notebook.

## Google Colab Instructions

Google Colab provides a preconfigured environment and free access to a GPU.

* Clone or download the GitHub repository in a folder
* Unzip the folder
* Move the folder to Google Drive
* Double click on the notebook and open with Google Colab
